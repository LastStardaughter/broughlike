**Untitled Broughlike**
I've been planning to experiment with roguelikes; however, in trying to understand libraries like libtcod, rot.js, and squidlib, I find I have some difficulty understanding what they're doing and why they're doing it. A few weeks ago I stumbled onto Jeremiah Reid's Broughlike tutorial at https://nluqo.github.io/broughlike-tutorial/ and, though it doesn't concern itself with best coding practices, from it I hope to learn more about *how* games like this work so I can better implement them in the future using advanced libraries and proper coding practices.
